TO SETUP REACT FOR CSS (SIMPLIST METHOD):

Setting up Webpack npm i css-loader style-loader --save-dev
set up a webpack.config.js file on the same directory as App.css.
Add the following code in the App.css. module.exports = { module: {
test: /.css$/, use: [ "style-loader", "css-loader" ]
}};
CSS Works! Don't forget to import with "../App.css"

*** Also, to get the CSS to work take the className and use only that i.e. .world { border: solid white; }


INSTALLING BOOTSTRAP/REACTSTRAP:

Installed jquery --save…

…, popper.js --save, and react-bootstrap bootstrap and then I needed import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'; to put into index.js, app.js, and on the component. I finally got bootstrap to work. YEA.
